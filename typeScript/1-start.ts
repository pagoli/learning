/*
What is TS?
=> powerful compiler;
=> nicer syntax, easier way of doing sth
=> "workarounds", possible to identify errors earlier on
+ A JS Superset, building up on Js
+ Adds new features + advantages to JS
- Browser/NodeJS (=JS environment) can't execute TS 

Why use TS?

example (JS)
function add(num1,num2){
  return num1+num2;
}
console.log(add("2","3"))  JS would concatinate the stirngs
